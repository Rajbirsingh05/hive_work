Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. 
One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
 
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest problems its residents face is parking. 
The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. 
This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The analysis can be divided into two parts:
 
Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
select count(*) from ny_tracffic where Issu_Date like '%2017%';
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
select distinct(registration_state) from ny_tracffic;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.) Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. 
Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )

select count(*) from ny_tracffic where street_code1 =0 or street_code2 =0 or street_code3 =0;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)

select  violation_code, count(violation_code) frequency_violation_codes from ny_traffic_partition group by violation_code order by frequency_violation_codes desc limit 5;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)

select vehicle_body_type, count(summons_num) parking_tickets from ny_traffic_partition group by vehicle_body_type order by parking_tickets desc limit 5;


select vehicle_make, count(summons_num) parking_tickets from ny_traffic_partition group by vehicle_make order by parking_tickets desc limit 5;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)

a. select violation_precinct, count(summons_num) as num_of_violation_occured from ny_traffic_partition group by violation_precinct order by num_of_violation_occured desc limit 5;

b. select issuer_precinct, count(summons_num) as num_of_violation_occured from ny_traffic_partition group by issuer_precinct order by num_of_violation_occured desc limit 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high 
frequency of certain violation codes?

select issuer_precinct, violation_code, count(violation_code) number_of_tickets from ny_traffic_partition group by issuer_precinct, violation_code order by number_of_tickets desc limit 10;

issuer_precinct violation_code  number_of_tickets
0       		36      		662765
0       		7       		210175
0       		21      		126050
18      		14      		50150
19      		46      		48444
0       		5       		48076
14      		14      		45036
1       		14      		38354
19      		38      		36386
19      		37      		36056

checking 3 issuer precinct(18,19,14) violation code frequency

select violation_code, count(*) number_of_tickets from ny_traffic_partition where issuer_precinct =18  group by  violation_code order by number_of_tickets desc limit 10;

14 69 are two major violation code 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. 
Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.

converting string into time

select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(regexp_extract(violation_time,'(.*)[A-Z]',1),'HHmm'),"HH:mm") as timestamp from ny_traffic_partition limit 3; ( this query will give output like 01:45)

select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(violation_time,'M'),"HHmmaaa"),"HH:mmaaa") as time from ny_traffic_partition limit 5; ( this query will give output like 01:45AM)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations

create view ny_traffic_partition_6_bins1 partitioned on(violation_code) as select summons_number, violation_time, issuer_precinct, violation_precinct,
case
when substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','12') and upper(substring(violation_time,-1))='A' then 1
when substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and upper(substring(violation_time, -1))='A' then 2
when substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and upper(substring(violation_time, -1))='A' then 3
when substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('12','01','02','03') and upper(substring(violation_time, -1))='P' then 4
when substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and upper(substring(violation_time, -1))='P' then 5
when substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and upper(substring(violation_time, -1))='P' then 6
else null end as bins, violation_code 
from ny_traffic_partition 
where violation_time is not null or (length(violation_time)=5 and upper(substring(violation_time,-1))in ('A','P')
and substring(violation_time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','04','05','06','07', '08','09','10','11','12'));


****************bin = 1 common violations **************************

select violation_code, count(violation_code)as common_violation from ny_traffic_partition_6_bins1 where bins =1 group by violation_code order by common_violation desc limit 10;

21      34703
40      23628

21      57896

****************bin = 3 common violations **************************

select violation_code, count(violation_code)as common_violation from ny_traffic_partition_6_bins1 where bins =3 group by violation_code order by common_violation desc limit 10;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)

violation code that are high frequency (21,36,37,38)

select bins, count(bins) ticket_issued from ny_traffic_partition_6_bins1 where violation_code in (21,36,37,38) group by bins order by ticket_issued limit 3;

3       1173198
4       768722
5       186993
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.) Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
      a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. 
(Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); 
Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))
 
 
create view ny_traffic_seasons partitioned on(violation_code) as select issu_date,issuer_precinct, case
when substring(issu_date,1,2) in ('03','04','05') then 'spring'
when substring(issu_date,1,2) in ('06','07','08') then 'summer'
when substring(issu_date,1,2) in ('09','10','11') then 'fall'
when substring(issu_date,1,2) in ('12','01','02') then 'winter'
else 'unknown' end as seasons, violation_code from ny_traffic_partition


select seasons,  count(*) as ticket_count from ny_traffic_seasons group by seasons order by ticket_count desc;
  
spring  2873380
winter  1704680
summer  852864
fall    979

    b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.

*******************spring*******************
select violation_code, count(*) ticket_count from ny_traffic_seasons where seasons = 'spring' group by violation_code order by ticket_count desc limit 3;
21      402424
36      344834
38      271167

******************* winter *******************
select violation_code, count(*) ticket_count from ny_traffic_seasons where seasons = 'winter' group by violation_code order by ticket_count desc limit 3;

21      238180
36      221268
38      187386

******************* summer *******************
select violation_code, count(*) ticket_count from ny_traffic_seasons where seasons = 'winter' group by violation_code order by ticket_count desc limit 3;

21      127350
36      96663
38      83518


******************* fall *******************
select violation_code, count(*) ticket_count from ny_traffic_seasons where seasons = 'winter' group by violation_code order by ticket_count desc limit 3;

46      231
21      128
40      116

21,36,38 are most common violation code.
